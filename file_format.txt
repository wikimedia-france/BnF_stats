------- File format of the BnF-WMFr partnership statistics -------

-- By book --
Line (separator = ` ')
- DjVu title with `_' as space, string: title
- BnF ID, number
- number of pages, number
- number of gray pages, number
- number of green pages, number
- number of yellow pages, number
- number of pink pages, number
- number of uncreated pages, number
- number of contributors, number
- number of IPs, number
- number of registred contributors, number
- list of contributors, with `|' as separator and `_' as space, string
- if finished: total time in seconds, else: 0, number
- mean Levenshtein distance for the last pink status, number
- mean Levenshtein distance for the last yellow status, number
- mean Levenshtein distance for the last green status, number
- standard deviation of the Levenshtein distance for the last pink status, number
- standard deviation of the Levenshtein distance for the last yellow status, number
- standard deviation of the Levenshtein distance for the last green status, number


-- By existing page --
Line (separator = ` ')
- BnF ID, number
- number of pages, number
- number of the page, number
- date of creation, date
* status at the creation, status: first_status
* last status, status: last_status
* list of contributors, with `|' as separator and `_' as space, string: contributors
- date of passage to gray, date
- date of passage to pink, date
- date of passage to yellow, date
- date of passage to green, date
* nonlinearity in the status detected, boolean
- raw Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last pink status, number
- raw Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last yellow status, number
- raw Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last green status, number
- finer Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last pink status (see below), number
- finer Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last yellow status (see below), number
- finer Levenshtein distance with the OCR at the last green status (see below), number


-- Format of data --

- status: `0'=uncreated, `1'=problem, `2'=gray, `3'=pink, `4'=yellow, `5'=green
- date: yyyymmddhhmmss
- boolean: `0' (false) or `1' (true)


-- Notes --

- Levenshtein distance makes more sense here compared to the Damerau-Levenshtein because an OCR don't make the error of transposing two characters
- finer Levenshtein distance remove `''', `'''', `{{centrÃ©|$1}}', `<noinclude' header and footer and replace all that by raw text
